With the Random guess algorithm
 - There's really no elimanation of possibilities as each answer set is checked.
 - This system really takes a long time and is inefficinet, and would get worse and worse with greater numbers of possibilities
 - With this system it would regularly take hundreds of answer checks

With Jack's algorithm
- The combination was set initially to 0,10,0 (for weapon, location, murder)
- with each return from assistantJack of 'a' wrong answer, that variable in incrimented, except for location which would be decrimented
- With each check, one combination is eliminated, and one variable possibility is removed from the pool (heavily eliminating possibilities)
_ This system would regularly find the answer to all 3 answer sets with around 13 answer checks.
- (Though 1 in 50 checks with the 'random' answer set would take around 22 answer checks.)
